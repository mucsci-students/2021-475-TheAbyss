## Media and Summary

Meet your nemesis and our close friend, the Shark! 

![SharkyBoi](https://i.imgur.com/BqUsIMW.png)

The Shark has custom written AI that allows him to avoid obstacles, set up patrol paths, and be as much of a menace to you as possible!

![SharkCone](https://i.imgur.com/Mon01fw.png)

The Shark has a massive cone of vision that allows him to lock onto players hiding even at what they may think is a safe distance. Was this a hawk or a shark?!

![SharkPatrol](https://i.imgur.com/qTqjtUH.png)

Once The Shark has arrived at his "Point of Interest" he will establish a patrol path where he will circle in search of you! While he is patrolling, he will deftly avoid obstacles and terrain. Dang, the guy who wrote that code must be pretty cool. 

![SharkScript](https://i.imgur.com/cjzQb6S.png)

Custom scripting allows us to utilize key-value pairs to set the shark's path at any given moment. Think you're too fast for our shark? Think again!

Huh, with an intellect like that, I wonder how many times you'll be seeing this screen?
