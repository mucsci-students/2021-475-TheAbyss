  message: "Hey man, be careful coming out of that cave. According to our scanners
    the  <b><color=red>shark</color></b> has been seen patrolling around your base.
    Don't let him see you, or else <color=red>we might not be able to save you in
    time.</color> \n\nTry to utilize <color=green>obstacles and terrain</color> to
    avoid his sightline. He seems to just be swimming in circles, so hopefully it
    should be relatively easy to avoid."
