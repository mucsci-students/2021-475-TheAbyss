  message: Hey, you are still alive and finding clues...this is great! We are so
    close now, just need to find a way to open that chest. Hopefully your new friend
    out there is not giving you to much trouble. Don't forget to use that harpoon
    gun you got to keep that thing away long enough to make us rich. According to
    what I am seeing there should be a cave over by that horse statue. See if you
    can find out what is there..maybe it will open this chest.
